JavaScript program to generate random number
    we can generate random number with math.random() function.
    math.random() returns a random floating points number ranging from 0 to less than 1(inclusive of 0 and enclusive of 1).

    we can use this value in the range (0,10) to find the random
    math.random * (endpoint - startpoint)+startpoint;
    This will show integer output on the range of 1 to 9 .
    so, inclusive method we used  Math.floor(Math.random()*(max -min +1)+min);

JavaScript program to solve Quatratic equation
    (i) JavaScript if----else statement
    (ii) JavaScript Math sqrt()

    This program Computes roots of a quadratic equation when its coefficient are known .
    the standard form of a quadratic equation is:
            ax^2+bx+c =0, where, a,b,c are the real number.

        To find the roots of such equation we use the formula,
            (root1, root2) = (-b +_ ((b2-4ac)/2)).

                HERE (b2-4ac)/2, is the discriminat of a quadratic equation.
                    if (this) >0 i.e real and different.
                    else if(this)=0 i.e real and equal.\
                    else if(this)<0 i.e complex and different.
    
// To check given number is positive , negative or zero
(i) JavaScript comparision and Logical operations
(ii) JavaScript if ------else statement

 // To check the number which is odd or even
 (i) Using if---else condition.
  (ii) by using ternary operator.
