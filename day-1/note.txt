// Javascript program to print Helloworld

Here, we will use these three ways to prints status
(i) console.log() or window() :- It is used in debugging the code.
                      console.log("Sandip);                                      
(ii) alert :- The alert() method display an alert box  over the current

(iii) document.write :- It is used when you want to print the content to the HTML document.

//javascript program to Add two number

You should have the knowledge of the following Javascript programming topics:
(a) JavaScript variable and constant :-We used var, let or const keyword are used to declare variable.
        eg:- let x=9;
(b) Javascript operator :- operator is a symbol which are perform operation on operand.They have include 
    Arithmetic ,Logical,comparision,Bitwish, Assignment,string operator etc.
        eg:- let (x+y)+4/2;

(c) Javascript Math.sqrt():- The sqrt() method is used to find square root of given value and return it.


//Javascript program is to find the area of triangle 
                here, If you known all the sides of a triangle you can find the area using Heron's formula.
                If a ,b,c are three side of triangle.

        area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))^0.5


    //    Using temporary variable
        swap variable
           let temp;
                temp = a;
                a=b;
                b = temp;

        Alternative,
        // Using Destructing assignment
                [a,b] = [b,a];

        // Assignment operators
                a= a+b;
                b= a-b;
                c = a-b;

        // Using Bitwise operator
                a = a^b;
                b = a^b;
                c = a^b;

// converting kilometer into miles
        fahrenheit = (celsius *1.8)+32;
